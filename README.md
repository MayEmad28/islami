I have developed a Flutter project that consists of multiple pages.
-The first page is the Quran page, which lists all sura names. When we click on a specific sura, it navigates to another page that contains the sura we selected. 
-The second page is the Hadith page which includes a list of 50 hadiths. When we click on a specific hadith, it navigates to another page that displays the hadith we selected.
-The third page, is a Sebha page. When we click on the text, it counts 33 for each zikr and then changes to another one."
-The fourth page is a Radio and it  is only about the user interface (UI) and we will proceed as planned.
-Finally settings page is where we can change the Language and theme

- On the Quran and Hadith page, users can access selected suras and hadiths from a file.
- Localizations and theming have been implemented using Provider.
